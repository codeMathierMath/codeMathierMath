Hi — I’m Liam.

I’m interested in the intersection of:
- Wireless systems, DSP, and SDR
- FPGA / hardware-software co-design
- Systems & low-level computation
- Mathematics (linear algebra, differential equations, modeling)
- Physics (mechanics, electromagnetism and waves)

This GitHub is a long-term lab notebook:
- focused, incremental projects
- real experiments (including failures)
- clear documentation over polish

## Current Focus
- RTL-SDR experimentation and signal analysis
- DSP fundamentals implemented from first principles
- Mathematical modeling of physical systems

## Background
- Intro to Computer Science (Java) @ Amherst College
- Self-directed study in mathematics and systems programming (MATLAB and R)
- Special Forces Communications Sergeant in the US Army
- Strong interest in RF, embedded systems, and HPC-adjacent work

## Philosophy
I care more about understanding *why systems work* than shipping fast demos.
Expect exploratory code, math notes, and iterative refinement.

## Projects

### Conway’s Game of Life (Java)
A discrete dynamical system implemented in Java, emphasizing state
representation, deterministic rule-based evolution, and toroidal
boundary conditions. Visualization is provided via StdDraw, with the
focus on clarity and correctness of the underlying model.

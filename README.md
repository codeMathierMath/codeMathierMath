Hi — I’m Liam.

I’m interested in the intersection of:
- Wireless systems, DSP, and SDR
- FPGA / hardware-software co-design
- Systems & low-level computation
- Mechanical Layout and CAD Modeling
- Mathematics (linear algebra, differential equations, modeling)
- Physics (mechanics, electromagnetism and waves)

This GitHub is a long-term lab notebook:
- focused, incremental projects
- real experiments (including failures)
- clear documentation over polish

## Current Focus
- SOLIDWORKS, Machining, and Systems Integration as Mechanical Team Lead for CanSat competition team (full lifecycle aerospace project incorporating design, test, and launch of can-sized satellite simulation)
- RTL-SDR experimentation and signal analysis (on hold for focus on CanSat deadline)
- DSP fundamentals implemented from first principles (on hold for focus on CanSat deadline)
- Mathematical modeling of physical systems

## Background
- Intro to Computer Science (Java) @ Amherst College
- Self-directed study in mathematics and systems programming (MATLAB and R)
- Special Forces Communications Sergeant in the US Army
- Strong interest in RF, embedded systems, and HPC-adjacent work

## Philosophy
I care more about understanding *why systems work* than shipping fast demos.
Expect exploratory code, math notes, and iterative refinement.

## Selected Projects

### Algorithm–Architecture Match (Java)
A performance modeling tool that explores how algorithm characteristics interact with hardware architectures using a roofline-inspired cost model. Users can simulate runtimes, compare tradeoffs, and reason about compute- vs. memory-bound behavior across CPUs, SIMD units, and GPU-like systems.

### Algorithm Audio Visualizer (Java)
An audio-visual exploration of sorting algorithms where algorithm state is mapped to both sound and visualization in real time. Highlights how algorithmic behavior manifests dynamically, using Merge Sort and Insertion Sort as initial case studies.

### Conway’s Game of Life (Java)
A discrete dynamical system implemented in Java, emphasizing state
representation, deterministic rule-based evolution, and toroidal
boundary conditions. Visualization is provided via StdDraw, with the
focus on clarity and correctness of the underlying model.
